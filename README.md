# ðŸ“Š Marketing Analytics Project â€“ ShopEasy Case Study

This project is a business case for **ShopEasy**, an online retail company facing challenges in customer engagement and conversion. Despite increased marketing investments, the company is not achieving the expected return on investment (ROI). As a data analyst, my role was to analyze various marketing performance metrics, customer reviews, and social media engagement to uncover the root causes and provide actionable recommendations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Objectives

- **Increase Conversion Rates**  
  Identify the key stages in the funnel where visitors drop off and provide strategies to optimize the conversion journey.

- **Enhance Customer Engagement**  
  Determine which types of content drive the most interaction and suggest improvements to boost overall engagement rates.

- **Improve Customer Feedback Scores**  
  Analyze customer reviews and sentiment to uncover patterns in satisfaction and dissatisfaction, leading to targeted improvements.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Conversion Rate** â€“ % of website visitors who complete a purchase  
- **Customer Engagement Rate** â€“ Interaction levels on marketing content (clicks, likes, comments)  
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** â€“ Average spend per customer per transaction  
- **Customer Feedback Score** â€“ Aggregated rating based on customer reviews  

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- ðŸ”» **Declining Conversion and Engagement**: Conversion rates dropped significantly in mid-year months, while marketing expenses increased, indicating inefficiency in campaign targeting and timing.

- ðŸ’¬ **Customer Sentiment Mixed**: While a large number of customers provided positive reviews, a substantial volume of mixed and negative reviews pointed toward dissatisfaction with service quality and delivery times.

- ðŸ“‰ **Low ROI on Marketing Campaigns**: Despite multiple campaign launches, social media and content engagement metrics were low, highlighting a need for refreshed content strategies and stronger call-to-actions.

- ðŸ›’ **High-Converting Product Categories Identified**: Certain products (e.g., Kayaks, Ski Boots) consistently outperformed others, suggesting an opportunity to focus marketing efforts on high-ROI categories during peak months.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**: Data extraction, cleaning, and aggregation  
- **Power BI**: Visualization of KPIs and insights
